# Project-Euler

This repo contains my solutions using javascript for the [Project Euler](www.projecteuler.net). However, it does not end there.
There is a microservice that provides access to those functions so you can easily use them to find solutions passing your own parameters as **json** or **urlencoded** input via a **POST** request.

## To-DO

- [ ] Make proper documentation.
- [ ] Solve the problems.
- [ ] Add script to generate range or ready problems.
- [ ] Build Front end page.
